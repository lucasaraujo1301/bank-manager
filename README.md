# bank-manager

## Overview
bank-manager is a console app created with C#, I did this project to practice what I learn from the C# syntax.

I did not use any kind of database, all the data saved is using the memory, so if stop the application, will lose all the data.

## How to use
First of all, you need to have the .Net installed in your machine, I used the .Net 9.0. [Download from here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/pt-br/download)

After installing the .Net, just clone this repository, open the terminal in the project path and run:

```bash
dotnet run
```

And now, just have fun!
