# bank-manager

## Overview
bank-manager is a console app to manage banks accounts.

You can create accounts from multiples banks, make deposit, withdraw and also transfer between account (ONLY for the same bank).

I did not use any kind of database, all the data saved is using the memory, so if stop the application, will lose all the data.

The propose of this project was to practice what I learn from C# syntax.

## How to use
First of all, you need to have the .Net installed in your machine, I used the .Net 9.0. [Download from here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/pt-br/download)

After installing the .Net, just clone this repository, open the terminal in the project path and run:

```bash
dotnet run
```

And now, just have fun!
